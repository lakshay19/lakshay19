Experienced data scientist with a demonstrated history of working in Data Science consulting. I have led several analytics projects end-to-end, including projects focused on generative AI, image segmentation, mixed integer programming, promotional response modeling analysis, customer journey analysis, segmentation analysis, and sales data analytics. I am skilled in analyzing large datasets in Python, R, SQL, SAS, and Excel, generating recommendations, and presenting them to the stakeholders through visuals in Microsoft PowerPoint and Tableau. 

I am passionate about problems that can be solved through data, and I get excited by all such unexplored possibilities in our tech-driven world. Throughout my five years of work experience, I have been fascinated by how much a group of people can achieve through a structured project and the first questions I ask when I start working on a new business problem are "Why is this problem important?", and "What's the best way we can tackle this as a group?". I am always looking for opportunities where I can enhance my Data Analytics/Data Science Skills.
