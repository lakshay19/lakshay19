### Hi there 👋

I'm an experienced data scientist with a demonstrated history of working in the analytics consulting industry. I have led several analytics projects end-to-end, including projects focused on promotional response modeling analysis, patient-level data analysis, customer journey, and sales data analytics. I am skilled in analyzing large datasets in Python, R, SQL, SAS, and Excel, generating recommendations, and presenting them to the stakeholders through visuals in Microsoft PowerPoint and Tableau.

Currently, I am pursuing the Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Management program at Purdue University. Through this program, I am seeking to further expand my breadth of technical knowledge of machine learning, formalize my business acumen, as well as get further industry exposure through experiential learning.

I am passionate about problems that can be solved through data, and I get excited by all such unexplored possibilities in our tech-driven world. Throughout my four years of work experience, I have been fascinated by how much a group of people can achieve through a structured project and the first questions I ask when I start working on a new business problem are "Why is this problem important?", and "What's the best way we can tackle this as a group?". I am always looking for opportunities where I can enhance my Data Analytics/Data Science Skills.
